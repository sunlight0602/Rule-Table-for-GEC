Product write - up by Harry [-Procedure　Analyze//PH-]{+I　analyzed//PH+} [-of//AR-]{+the//AR+} quality and characteristics of the new electronic dictionary by [-test//WC-]{+testing//WC+} and comparison with others of the same style .
[-Finds//WC-]{+Features　://WC+} 1 .
This electronic dictionary is bigger than {+the//AR+} others of the same category .
It has [-a//D-] great performance .
Conclusion {+://PU+} Despite the quality and great performance , this new version of the electronic dictionary is more expensive than expected .
By [-analyze//WC-]{+analyzing//WC+} [-of//D-] [-the//WC-]{+its//WC+} characteristics and performance , [-in//PR-]{+at//PR+} this moment {+it//MW+} would be more advantageous [-for　the　company//D-] to buy the [-extended//WC-]{+upgraded//WC+} version .
Recommendations {+://PU+} It [-s//VT-]{+would　be//VT+} more appropriate to buy the [-extended//WC-]{+upgraded//WC+} version of the new electronic dictionary .
4.Learn by experience Maybe , you can be a good leader already , but you can become {+an//AR+} even better leader by learning more skills .
Always be ready [-for//PR-]{+to//PR+} learn .
First of all lets analyze both groups according [-with//PR-]{+to//PR+} a recent research of the marketing department .
The research was divided into two demographic groups : group 1 shows 15 to 19 year old women {+,//PU+} while the group 2 shows 18 to 24 year old men .
It 's important to notice that already exist 6 competitive products [-to//MW-]{+in//MW+} the group 1 {+,//PU+} [-what//WC-]{+which//WC+} can be a con if compared to
The group 2 that [-have//AG-]{+has//AG+} just 1 long term and 2 recent competitive products .
Its estimated that in 2025 [-the//D-] group 2 will reach the mark of 244 billion of purchasing power , [-what//WC-]{+which//WC+} [-represent//AG-]{+represents//AG+} a positive [-diference//SP-]{+difference//SP+} of 70 billion in relation to group 1 .
The vantages of [-considere//SP-]{+considering//SP+} with more attention the possibility of [-invest//VT-]{+investing//VT+} [-on//WC-]{+in//WC+} the group 2 are undeniable .
I got your letter , and its really good to know that you are open to learn and get more [-health//WC-]{+healthy//WC+} financial habits .
{+It//MW+} [-Will//C-]{+will//C+} be a pleasure {+for　me//MW+} to help you on this .
First of all , you have to make a budget to find out how much money you can expend [-with//PR-]{+on//PR+} food .
After you defined it , your goal will be try to stay within {+the//AR+} budget .
Some choices can make your life easier , [-by//D-] example try to buy all {+the//AR+} food [-that//D-] you need .
To be more exact , food enough [-to//PR-]{+for//PR+} a month .
But remember : [-never//C-]{+Never//C+} go to {+the//AR+} supermarket when you are hungry , that will make you want to buy unnecessary things .
Another good thing to do is invite your friends to [-expend　some　time//XC-]{+have　a　meal//XC+} in your house instead {+of//MW+} [-go//VT-]{+going//VT+} out .
[-Combine　a　rotation//XC-]{+Rotate　the　homes//XC+} , [-every　time　in　one　house　and　by//D-] {+its//IS+} sure you will have great moments of pure fun !
Try to save some money [-to　go　to//XC-]{+by　not　going　to//XC+} restaurants or to [-dinner//PL-]{+dinners//PL+} with your friends [-,//PU-]{+.//PU+} [-but　keep　in　mind　that　it　must　be　a　exception　not　a　rule　.//D-] And good luck !

Generally employees are happy with the pay scales , vacation days and sick days , but there are comments on the overtime structure as people feel they are regularly expected to work around the clock without getting any reward for [-that//WC-]{+it//WC+} .
The only complaint refers to the long time ( 2 years ) to be employed with the company before you become [-allegable//SP-]{+eligible//SP+} for the Advanced Package .
The Employees are mainly happy with both in terms of having all the [-neccessary//SP-]{+necessary//SP+} equipment and of understanding their aims and objectives , but some [-committed//WC-]{+admitted//WC+} that the appraisal system is not really thorough enough , which means the staff do not get [-a//D-] proper feedback about their performance .
The survey reveals that there are too many layers of management in the company which [-does//WC-]{+do//WC+} not allow the employees to get a decision on something quickly as it has to pass through [-a　too　long　line//WO-]{+too　long　a　line//WO+} of reporting .

You are afraid of crowded {+,//PU+} confined spaces .
So I understand that our new office location makes you [-not//D-] feel [-comfortable//SP-]{+uncomfortable//SP+} because you have to take the subway and your workspace {+which//IS+} is now smaller .
Your [-felling//SP-]{+feeling//SP+} of anxiety , your breathing problems when you have to move in the office corridors can disappear completely !
I ve heard of a new technique which [-name//D-] is cognitive Behavioural Therapy .

I hope you understand and if you give permission , [-make　sure//XC-]{+please　be　assured//XC+} I will do extra work next weekend , for the lost day .

How much will it cost if we [-take//WC-]{+get//WC+} a lawyer ?
The opportunity of buying a house , would allow {+me//MW+} to save money and would bring us a good sense of stability .
[-Futhermore//SP-]{+Furthermore//SP+} , the tax benefits are very interesting nowadays , and , definitely , I am sure it 's the right moment to buy .
As you will able to see , my wage as a [-Director//C-]{+director//C+} is $ 4000 per month and my currently expenses is around $ 2500 .
I think I have {+an//AR+} adequate income in order to afford the mortgage payments .
Not only do I have a lot of experiences [-of//PR-]{+in//PR+} teaching , but above all , because I have the motivation and the desire to help people [-to//D-] become fit and healthy .
I have some excellent certificates and [-many//WC-]{+much//WC+} knowledge [-s//D-] about nutrition .
Consequently , I will be able to give some advice [-s//D-] about different way {+s//PL+} to be in a good shape .
I have been working for a long time as {+a//AR+} personal trainer and my clients enjoy my high level of skills .
I am confident and outgoing {+,//PU+} and it 's always a pleasure for me to involve people in my passion .
As [-usually//PS-]{+usual//PS+} , she was going out to work early in the morning , [-when//WC-]{+then//WC+} she saw a young couple who [-was//AG-]{+were//AG+} vandalizing the local newsagents .
My friend was terrified and scared , {+and//IS+} she [-was//D-] [-thinking//VT-]{+thought//VT+} she [-could//WC-]{+would//WC+} die .
Then , a nice passer - by caught her by the hair , but it was n't [-her//D-] hair , but a wig [-...//PU-]{+,//PU+} and not a woman but a teenage boy !
[-Unfortunatelly//SP-]{+Unfortunately//SP+} , she turned and ran .
[-Anyone//WC-]{+No　one//WC+} has [-never//D-] been able to catch them , and my friend is still scared to leave her house .
On the other hand , if she has to work under [-the//D-] pressure she is able to do a good job , because she has great ability .
This story takes place on a {+cruise//MW+} liner , in 1912 , with two main characters .
Rose wanted to {+commit//MW+} suicide to escape from her family [-contraints//SP-]{+constraints//SP+} , but she [-has　been//XC-]{+was//XC+} rescued by Jack .
They [-have　been　falling//VT-]{+fell//VT+} in love , despite Rose 's [-family　disagree//XC-]{+family's　disapproval//XC+} , because they [-had　not//XC-]{+did　not　have//XC+} the same social standing and Rose had to get married with a rich man .
Therefore , they [-have　been//D-] hid in the [-cale//NSW-]{+car//NSW+} .
Suddenly , in the night , [-anybody//WC-]{+nobody//WC+} saw the iceberg .
The liner [-hurts//XC-]{+hit//XC+} it , and [-it　has　begun//XC-]{+the　ship　began//XC+} to sink .
[-Everyone　hasn't　been　able　to　save　one's　life//XC-]{+not　everyone's　lives　were　saved//XC+} .
The new Transformer Translator [-is//WC-]{+has//WC+} finally arrived on the market today .
Many people [-was//VT-]{+are//VT+} looking forward to buying one , and the most of the US stores , like {+the//AR+} Best Buy or {+the//AR+} PC Center [-has　been　delivered//PH-]{+have　the　stock//PH+} .
[-So//WC-]{+Therefore//WC+} , you can get it right now !
The new TT is not very expensive , only $ 235 , and has many [-capacities//WC-]{+features//WC+} [-on//PR-]{+in//PR+} it .
It 's the smallest one , about the size of your palm , light , and weighs only 10 [-oz//PL-]{+ozs//PL+} .
It 's a good one for runners [-,//D-] because it has a pedometer included .
The other [-original//WC-]{+unique//WC+} feature it 's {+is//IS+} the world time zone clock [-enclosed//D-] .
This [-item//WC-]{+product//WC+} is really unique , and state - of - the art , {+and//IS+} at the same time {+,//PU+} modern [-and　current//D-] .
[-Comparatively//PS-]{+Compared//PS+} to the other ones , this new product is really innovative , with many features , and {+it　is//IS+} simple to use .
{+It　is//IS+} [-The//C-]{+the//C+} best on the market nowadays .
Here {+is//IS+} a summary of {+the//AR+} findings [-from//PR-]{+of//PR+} the survey .
When asked if they {+would//IS+} change their voices depending on whom they are talking to , 81 % said " yes " , especially to ensure {+that//IS+} they are understood .
When asked what English accents they dislike the most , 55 % said those from the Midlands area of the UK , closely followed [-by//PR-]{+at//PR+} 45 % [-who　consider　this//IS-]{+by　the//IS+} [-one//D-] [-from//D-] Liverpool [-was　the　best//IS-]{+accent//IS+} , [-maybe　because//IS-]{+in　spite　of　the//IS+} [-of　the//D-] fact {+that//IS+} the incredibly popular Beatles came from this city .
Nevertheless , 60 % said they like [-the　most//D-] Standard English accent {+the　most//IS+} , whereas 35 % [-prefer//IS-]{+liked//IS+} {+the//AR+} Scottish accent .
According to the survey , more than 72 % said they have a moderately strong accent , 4 % consider to have a very strong accent , and only 6 % said [-to//IS-]{+they//IS+} have no accent , even though [-everyone　has　one//IS-]{+standard　English　was　considered　an　accent//IS+} .
This self - help book is very motivating , but is [-that//WC-]{+it//WC+} really possible to change your current job , even though you could n't wish for anything better in your life [-.//PU-]{+?//PU+} I think it [-was//VT-]{+is//VT+} not so easy , otherwise everyone would be happy in their career , and nobody [-will//WC-]{+would//WC+} be suffering from anxiety or [-will//WC-]{+would//WC+} be under stress at work .
Unfortunately these [-fellings//SP-]{+feelings//SP+} occur more and more nowadays .
To my dismay , I saw my own son who has had a successful school career [-to　be　resigned　to　immigrate//PH-]{+be　retrenched　and　forced　to　emigrate//PH+} to another country because he did n't have the opportunity to find an appropriate job here .
Obviously , you can always learn about your [-personnality//SP-]{+personality//SP+} [-,//D-] {+and//MW+} your centre of interest , but what could it change ?
It 's a good [-point//WC-]{+way//WC+} to improve your [-knowledges//SI-]{+knowledge//SI+} and your relationship with other members of our company {+who　are//MW+} abroad .
My standpoint is that many [-informations//SI-]{+information//SI+} should be secured to avoid some [-leak//PL-]{+leaks//PL+} .
Consequently , you have to follow [-these　advices//SI-]{+this　advice//SI+} :
Maintain barriers between you and your [-negociating//SP-]{+negotiating//SP+} partner to avoid unnecessary rumors about the plans of our company , dishonest competitors could take advantage of that situation .
Have a limited profile [-in　reducing//XC-]{+and　reduce//XC+} what appears on it , write only your job title and your experience .
Block specific [-informations//SI-]{+information//SI+} to preserve our internal company structure .
{+Provided　we//IS+} [-Control//C-]{+control//C+} [-their//WC-]{+our//WC+} professional behavior , {+the//AR+} [-internet//C-]{+Internet//C+} could be a good way to broaden our customer base too .
Social - networking is only a technical and a functional way to get [-informations//SI-]{+information//SI+} , in any case it has to be used for your private life .
On the other hand , a brain is a [-kind　of//D-] sponge and the sponge absorbs less when you are not [-enough　young//WO-]{+young　enough//WO+} to learn .
If only I was ten years younger , that [-will//WC-]{+would//WC+} be easier !
Therefore , to help me with vocabulary , I have [-made//WC-]{+gotten//WC+} a note - book and I have been writing every new [-words//SI-]{+word//SI+} down since [-the　beginning　I　have　been//PH-]{+I　started//PH+} [-learning//WC-]{+studying//WC+} English .
Then , I use [-mnemonics//SI-]{+mnemonic//SI+} strategies .
Nevertheless , I think it 's never too late to learn , and I wish I could be fluent in English very soon , and I {+will//IS+} focus my attention on it for a few months .
He was an elderly oil [-thycoon//SP-]{+tycoon//SP+} and retired so far .
He was as deaf as a post and did n't want to wear a hearing aid [-by//WC-]{+out　of//WC+} pride .
[-By//PR-]{+On//PR+} a cold and dark evening , in December 1990 , [-whereas//WC-]{+while//WC+} he was watching a movie , he did n't hear someone who was breaking the window to enter and rob his money .
[-But//WC-]{+However//WC+} many people are unhappy with overtime and do n't get anything back for that .
[-But//WC-]{+However//WC+} two years is a long time before to become eligible for the advanced package , maybe eighteen months would be more realistic .
The employees are mainly happy with {+the//AR+} working environment , both in terms and having the necessary equipment and understanding their aims and objectives , but the staff do n't get enough feedback about the performance , and maybe regular and informal [-meeting//PL-]{+meetings//PL+} could be useful .
The delays of reporting are too long , so , one way to avoid that is to allow the managers to be more autonomous and maybe to remove some of [-them//XC-]{+the　reporting　lines//XC+} .
I know exactly what [-you//WC-]{+your//WC+} requirements are .
Therefore , I will be not just {+be//PR+} a figurehead , but a [-leadership//WC-]{+leader//WC+} with action .
I want not only to hold your [-etablished//SP-]{+established//SP+} privileges , but also to improve your working conditions .
I can not encourage you enough to make the right choice , and if you vote for me , all [-you//WC-]{+your//WC+} needs will be satisfied .
I have a three bedrooms apartment {+available//MW+} for rent in a very nice area of Pacific Heights .
The spacious and sunny living room has fabulous built - in wood [-bookselves//SP-]{+bookshelves//SP+} and the dining room has a fabulous views towards south .
Every room has [-harwood//SP-]{+hardwood//SP+} floors , except the kitchen which [-is//WC-]{+has//WC+} ceramic tile floor , [-consequently//D-] easy to clean .
In the hall {+,//PU+} there is an original wood staircase to go upstairs to the bedrooms .
One bathroom is next to the double room , therefore very airy and bright , with chrome fixtures [-,//PU-]{+;//PU+} another one is in the corridor .
Behind the house {+,//PU+} there is a beautiful closed garden with a few fruit trees and flowers [-borders//D-] all around the rustic porch .
The rent is affordable [-for　all　these　fixtures　and　fittings//D-] [-,//PU-]{+://PU+} only $ 1,850 per month .
This is a spacious house , [-trim　throught　house//D-] and perfect for a young couple with kids .
This movement began in Paris as a reaction to [-a//D-] very formal and traditional styles of painting .
He was [-devoted　much　of//PH-]{+very　much　devoted　to//PH+} painting animals .
He painted various fragmented [-objets//SP-]{+objects//SP+} , as if seen from multiple viewpoints .
Besides , I have never had a [-tendancy//SP-]{+tendency//SP+} to overindulge , and I have never drink or smoke .
I have a job security , because I am a civil [-servent//SP-]{+servant//SP+} for more than thirty years now .
However , my one fear is to become too [-much//D-] fond of them , and to be set on having all of them at home .
{+Salutation//MW+} In my viewpoint , the most representative and appropriate slogan is the first one " Century is timeless beauty " .
Additionally , [-that//WC-]{+it//WC+} highlights at the same time the image of our classic and luxury products , but also the reliability and the perfection of our brand .
[-That//WC-]{+It//WC+} could be a good campaign [-advertising//D-] and a real selling point .
Regarding the picture joined to the slogan , if you do n't mind my saying so , I would have [-choosen//SP-]{+chosen//SP+} an actress to represent our brand , instead of someone who nobody has [-never//WC-]{+ever//WC+} heard of , even though this one is glamorous and sensual , and got a real class .
Therefore , to improve our image , a beautiful actress [-should//WC-]{+would//WC+} be more attractive [-!//PU-]{+.//PU+} {+Closing//MW+} {+Name//MW+}

Dear James , [-some//C-]{+Some//C+} serious problems have been brought to my attention relating to your working style and habits .
Let me outline the areas {+you　have　to　improve//IS+} [-,//PU-]{+.//PU+} [-you//C-]{+You//C+} do n't think about teamwork , {+you//IS+} never update the database , {+you//IS+} do n't keep clean and have been late for several appointments , this is a very [-badly//PS-]{+bad//PS+} habit [-,//D-] because teamwork is very important , so you you must communicate with colleagues , [-attention//PS-]{+attend//PS+} to [-do//D-] something on time , must be more tidy and more [-professinal//SP-]{+professional//SP+} .
It 's the season for colds and [-flus//SP-]{+flues//SP+} , I have lots of traditional [-medicine//XC-]{+medicines//XC+} {+which//IS+} can help people .
People get aches and pains , but they do n't want to take an aspirin , they can drink a tea made from white willow bark and cayenne pepper ; {+if//IS+} people get a high fever , they do n't want to go to the doctor , they can wear socks soaked in vinegar and thyme ; people have a sore throat , or [-theyhave//SP-]{+they　have//SP+} been [-coughted//SP-]{+coughed//SP+} [-fro//XC-]{+for//XC+} a long time , and they do n't [-want//WC-]{+need//WC+} {+to//IS+} drink cough syrup , they can drink a spoonful of honey [-and//EX-]{+mixed　with//EX+} ginger .
I like the food and drinking , because [-i//C-]{+I//C+} make food for myself everyday .
Sometime [-i//C-]{+I//C+} grill a little meat , you know that meat is very delicious , but [-i//C-]{+I//C+} often make burnt meat , Ah~ [-i//C-]{+I//C+} am so sad for that .
About drinking , [-i//C-]{+I//C+} usually had soup when [-i//C-]{+I//C+} ate supper .
For those beverage , for example Coca Cola , [-i//C-]{+I//C+} do n't like drink them when [-i//C-]{+I//C+} have dinner .

I 'm planning my birthday party [-for//PR-]{+on//PR+} Thursday {+the//AR+} 6 [-th//SP-]{+Th//SP+} May at 1 pm .
The address of the party {+venue//MW+} is No .
Let me know {+if//MW+} you {+are//AG+} [-come//WC-]{+comming//WC+} .
I [-grow//VT-]{+grew//VT+} up in Certaldo , where I studied {+in//PR+} primary school .
I moved to Florence in 1998 when I started [-the//D-] university .
I graduated in [-Informatic//SP-]{+Informatics//SP+} Engineering on July 9th 2010 .

Hey [-boys//C-]{+Boys//C+} [-!//PU-]{+,//PU+} The safari was wonderful !
There were many animals , one more beautiful than [-another//XC-]{+the　other//XC+} .
The monkeys are as friendly as people , but they 're sometimes [-noising//XC-]{+noisy//XC+} .
They have [-a//D-] short , brown fur and a long tail .
[-When　you//XC-]{+You　should//XC+} go on {+a//AR+} safari [-you　have　to　go//D-] !
Then , Isabella tells [-to//D-] John of [-the//D-] her {+being//MW+} imminently married and that she does n't want to marry the bad man .
After that , John asks [-to//D-] her to escape together because he is madly in love with her .
The next night , they [-down　from//WC-]{+leave//WC+} the ship and leave the city .
Finally , they arrive in Brazil where they marry and live [-happy//WC-]{+happily//WC+} .
The e - ticket is a document that you must bring from home [-for//PR-]{+to//PR+} show that you have bought [-a//AR-]{+an//AR+} air flight .
You do {+a//AR+} good trip and enjoy !
Hi [-,//D-] [-man//SP-]{+Mom//SP+} and [-dad//C-]{+Dad//C+} [-://PU-]{+,//PU+} I 'm going to go to a music festival this weekend .
Wish you have a good [-weenkend//SP-]{+weekend//SP+} !
[-yours//C-]{+Yours//C+} ,
I am planning a party for my birthday on next [-friday//C-]{+Friday//C+} at 6 pm .
I hope all of you can [-coming//VT-]{+come//VT+} and I am making a big cake and preparing some wine and cola for it .
Waiting for you {+to//MW+} [-coming//VT-]{+come//VT+} !
Hi Jeff {+and　Amy//MW+} , [-I　also　this　picture　is　great　too　and//D-] [-the//C-]{+The//C+} monkey is very friendly with people .
[-Hi　Amy　.//D-] [-Yes　,　you're　right　.//D-] [-She　is　very　cute　as　more　clever　as　parrots　and　cats　.//D-] {+The　monkeys　are　social　animals　.　They　live　on　trees　in　groups　.　They　swing　from　branches　.　They　are　clever　,　they　can　imitate　us　.　Some　people　keep　monkeys　as　pets//NS+} {+We　can　see　the　monkeys　in　the　zoo　,　safari　or　in　their　natural　habitats　in　the　jungles　.//NS+} {+I　like　monkeys　.//NS+} {+Bye　,//MW+} {+Your　name//MW+}
I am going to go to a music [-featival//SP-]{+festival//SP+} , the music festival starts July 27th and ends July 30th , and the festival ticket need 49 pounds , it 's cheap {+.//PU+}
What could one [-earthquak//SP-]{+earthquake//SP+} bring ?
Yes , I also stand on that point , but further more , it would also bring us hope and love [-followingly//SP-]{+following//SP+} just as what " Tangshan Earthquake " told us .
The leading lady played by Xufan [-payed//WC-]{+lived//WC+} nearly half of her life within [-guiltiness//WC-]{+guilt//WC+} on the loss of her husband and especially on the lovely daughter ; meanwhile her [-survive//WC-]{+surviving//WC+} daughter lived [-along//D-] with [-hating//WC-]{+hate//WC+} .
But both of them never lost the hope and love [-even//WC-]{+even　though//WC+} they [-hided//WC-]{+hid//WC+} {+it//MW+} deeply .
Finally they met together , the hope and love [-going//WC-]{+went//WC+} forward ...
I have to say that Xufan successfully played the mother role , her [-superburb//SP-]{+superb//SP+} performance plus affective story touched all the audience that most [-bursted//SP-]{+burst//SP+} into tears .
Maybe not {+a//AR+} blockbuster about love but it 's worth watching .
I heard that you [-wan　na//XC-]{+want　to//XC+} quit your job due to your claustrophobia , what a pity for you !
In fact I believe you can overcome claustrophobia if you plan to [-despite//PS-]{+and//PS+} it 's not easy .
Even {+though//MW+} fainting , {+a//AR+} racing heart , or [-sweaty//XC-]{+sweating//XC+} and so on may {+be//PS+} blame on you , you should never consider [-they//PS-]{+them//PS+} [-are//PS-]{+as//PS+} irrational .
The second point , do the best to overcome {+your//PO+} claustrophobia .
For example {+,//PU+} stay in one enclosed room for one min , and then increase the time gradually [-time　to　time　till//PR-]{+until//PR+} you get used to it and you feel there 's little reason to be afraid , details you may refer to CBI .
Meanwhile {+you　can//PS+} get help from medication .
The last point , your recent job is fantastic and where your [-intrest//SP-]{+interest//SP+} [-lays//XC-]{+lies//XC+} , do n't you think it will be one big [-lost//XC-]{+loss//XC+} when you leave just because of your claustrophobia ?
Anyway , there [-is//PS-]{+are//PS+} always [-being//D-] [-ticky//SP-]{+tricky//SP+} [-hurdle//PL-]{+hurdles//PL+} in front of both of us , what we should do is to beat them {+,//PU+} but not quit .
With the excellent fitness skills and communication skills , [-i//C-]{+I//C+} can easily help the trainees {+to//PR+} improve their abilities .

Let me tell you [-why//D-] why [-you　should//WO-]{+should　you//WO+} apply for [-to　do//D-] it .
Just this morning {+,//PU+} I read the job ad [-on//PR-]{+in//PR+} the newspaper and I thought " ...
Your task will consist [-in//PR-]{+of//PR+} preparing food for animals and feeding them every day .
Would you prefer to work as {+a//AR+} secretary in a office spending all your time answering phones or giving information ?
[-Speack//SP-]{+Speak//SP+} to you later .

It 's a very fine cottage , with a [-beatiful//SP-]{+beautiful//SP+} view and stunning sunsets , but probably it 's too little for four persons .
It 's true that is possible {+to　build//MW+} an extension up to 150 sq m but they prefer not to make too many renovations .
The last property is [-undoubtely//SP-]{+undoubtedly//SP+} the most suitable for the Blights : quite spacious for the needs of the whole family , with a broad enough garden where the children can play , with a bay front and mountain scapes [-surronding//SP-]{+surrounding//SP+} it , suitable for rental .
The survey has been conducted by interviewing thousands {+of//PR+} consumers in Shanghai and an equal number in Rio de Janeiro .
Only 20 % of consumers do not approve our products , but only 40 % would buy them : this mean that we need to [-enphasize//SP-]{+emphasize//SP+} some characteristics that our products do have : in particular [-their//D-] being an expression of [-the//D-] western life - style .
The recommendations of the survey are also very important : so we have to try a little more sporty design , with colours more strong ( [-preferibly//SP-]{+preferably//SP+} black and white ) and a slightly bigger size .
Hereinafter Ill [-refer//WC-]{+relay　to//WC+} you a very terrifying fact that happened [-last//WC-]{+yesterday//WC+} [-Morning//C-]{+morning//C+} to my friend Meg , that [-demonstrate//AG-]{+demonstrates//AG+} how serious the problem of vandalism has become , in our city .
That day , as usual during the working week , [-he//WC-]{+she//WC+} was going to work by walk ( it was a beautiful sunny day ) when [-he//WC-]{+she//WC+} saw a young couple get out of a car and start to vandalize the local newsagent .
[-He//WC-]{+She//WC+} tried to stop them , but the woman , who had long hair over her face and eyes , pushed the gun into [-his//WC-]{+her//WC+} stomach .
[-He//WC-]{+She//WC+} was terrified !
She managed to escape but the hair were a wig , and the young woman [-turns//VT-]{+turned//VT+} out to be a teenage boy .
They have nt caught the couple yet and its [-scaring//WC-]{+scary//WC+} to think about them still out there and its worrying to think that a normal day could turn out , suddenly , [-in//WC-]{+to　be//WC+} the most terrifying day of your life .

[-dear//C-]{+Dear//C+} Tom , [-unfortunately//C-]{+Unfortunately//C+} I came [-in//PR-]{+to//PR+} the second part of my vacation , the first half has gone by too quickly .
About a month ago , being bored [-of//WC-]{+with//WC+} my life , {+I//MW+} suddenly decided to buy the [-cheaper//WC-]{+cheapest//WC+} fare I {+could//MW+} found and travel to India .
Arriving at the airport of Milan to check in , I found out that the flight was not direct and I was [-sittig//SP-]{+sitting//SP+} [-my//D-] against the wall at the bottom of the plane with the back not moving .
[-dear//C-]{+Dear//C+} stranger ,
When I received your mail , I was very surprised : the only explanation I can give [-me//WC-]{+myself//WC+} was that you made [-?　?//D-] a mistake in sending the mail .
But , dear stranger , I thank you because , for one moment , I deluded myself and this made [-?　?//D-] me feel good .
I suggest you return the mail to the proper addressee , and .. [-good//C-]{+Good//C+} luck in your love story
I could just make an observation about the terrible noise in the dining room that prevents the unfolding of a normal conversation and makes [-less　pleasant　the　meal//PH-]{+the　meal　less　pleasant//PH+} .
I think that it would be sufficient {+to　have//MW+} some sound absorption panels in the ceiling to resolve the problem .
I 'm glad I have advanced to next step and I would like you {+to//PR+} know me better .
I would like to follow a course of {+to//PR+} study online because my work schedule is not predictable and often I am away on business .
Actually {+,//PU+} I could not keep a commitment to specific and repetitive times .
Studying online {+,//PU+} I can choose the times and ways and I can study everywhere {+,//PU+} it 's enough to have an [-internet//C-]{+Internet//C+} connection .

It is very impressive and [-convincible//WC-]{+convincing//WC+} {+.//PU+} [-when//D-] I read about her anxiety [-from//PR-]{+because　of//PR+} her [-dilemmatic//WC-]{+problematic//WC+} career path {+which//PS+} {+caused//VT+} confusion : she felt dissatisfied {+with//PR+} her achievements and she had no idea {+about//PR+} how to tackle the search for a new and more gratifying career path .
[-Making//PU-]{+Making//PU+} a career change , whether consciously chosen or by being downsized or laid off , is inherently stressful and challenging .
According to the author , the key to change [-the//D-] discontent {+at//PR+} [-job//WC-]{+work//WC+} depends on a deep self- [-personality//D-] [-exploration//PU-]{+exploration//PU+} to determine what it is that will make a job gratifying .
She also claims that in order to achieve this we need to build up a {+picture//PS+} {+of//PR+} {+the//AR+} nature of our common associates so that we can reveal the kind of personalities we would feel comfortable {+with//PR+} .
I do n't know enough vocabulary for [-the//D-] daily [-using//XC-]{+use//XC+} and academic [-study//PL-]{+studies//PL+} .
To improve my vocabulary , I [-will//D-] practice vocabulary as [-following　way//XC-]{+follows//XC+} : Write down [-everything　I　know　about//D-] new words {+that　I　come　across//IS+} that will be useful for me .
{+Then　I//IS+} [-Decide//C-]{+decide//C+} if I will need to know how to [-write　and　speak　a　word//XC-]{+use　them　in　sentences//XC+} , or if I just have to know the meaning when I hear or read it .
If I [-will//D-] need to [-write　or　speak//XC-]{+use//XC+} the word , I need to know more about it , such as the pronunciation and the grammar {+,//PU+} and definitely I will need [-an//AR-]{+a//AR+} dictionary .
I also can use these sentence when [-taking//WC-]{+talking//WC+} to [-another//XC-]{+others//XC+} or study - mates to see if they understand .

There are three reasons [-that//WC-]{+why//WC+} you should apply for it .
Second , you can work outside when you feed {+the//AR+} animals .
You [-dont//SP-]{+do　n't//SP+} need to just sit in the office .
The last reason is that to be honest , the salary and [-benefit//PL-]{+benefits//PL+} [-is//AG-]{+are//AG+} by far better than your present job !

[-direct//C-]{+Direct//C+} discrimination
In your interview 's experience , [-do　you//D-] have you met any situation about asking your domestic [-circustance//SP-]{+circumstance//SP+} ?
If so , did the boss demote your position or salaries when you [-return　on//PH-]{+returned　to　the//PH+} job ?
Indirect [-discrimation//SP-]{+discrimination//SP+} 2.1 .
Furthermore , if you have to take care your children so that you can not overwork , as a result , your boss did not promote you even if you [-had　contribution//WC-]{+contributed//WC+} in your company .
[-do//C-]{+Do//C+} you think it is reasonable or not ?

The line chart shows {+national　and　international//IS+} sales [-figure//PL-]{+figures//PL+} of Best Books Company [-between　National　and　International//D-] from 2004 to 2008 .
The sales figures of the [-International//C-]{+international//C+} market [-was//AG-]{+were//AG+} more than the [-National//C-]{+national//C+} market from the [-book　company//D-] starting .
After 2006 , the sales figures of the [-National//C-]{+national//C+} market [-extended　its　size　and//XC-]{+increased　and　became//XC+} more than {+the//AR+} [-International//C-]{+international//C+} market .
The Best Books Company launched itself [-from//PR-]{+in//PR+} 2004 and focused on {+the//AR+} [-International//C-]{+international//C+} market {+,//PU+} so the sales figures from {+the//AR+} international {+market//MW+} [-had//WC-]{+showed//WC+} sharp growth until 2005 to [-2//SP-]{+two//SP+} millions .
After 2005 , the sales figures from {+the//AR+} international {+market//MW+} dropped each year to 0.5 millions .
In contrast , {+the//AR+} [-National//C-]{+national//C+} market steadily [-had　steadily//D-] increased its sales from 2004 to 2007 to 2.5 millions .
It [-was　a//XC-]{+reached　the//XC+} peak [-on//PR-]{+in//PR+} 2007 , and then [-its//WC-]{+it//WC+} [-had//D-] slightly reduced to 1.8 millions [-on//PR-]{+in//PR+} 2008 .
In conclusion , the sales figures from Best Books [-company//C-]{+Company//C+} had gradually transferred its market from international to national .
Therefore , the international sales figures [-was//AG-]{+were//AG+} [-more//WC-]{+better//WC+} than national sales {+figures//MW+} [-after//PR-]{+from//PR+} 2006 to 2008 .

There was a promise to see wild animals [-like//WC-]{+such　as//WC+} bald eagles , dolphins , bears and moose {+,//PU+} but we did n't see [-anyone//WC-]{+any//WC+} of them .

[-And//D-] [-my//C-]{+My//C+} favorite are exciting movies .
I see the most points of the survey are similar to [-me//WC-]{+mine//WC+} .
My opinion [-to//PR-]{+of//PR+} Gavin Taylor .
I am [-do　n't//XC-]{+not//XC+} interested [-at//PR-]{+in//PR+} gossip [-.　But//CO-]{+,　but//CO+} everybody talks about stars at least sometimes .
[-We　should　leave　to　life　our　stars//PH-]{+We　should　let　our　stars　be　.//PH+} .
It 's possible that Gavin and Alana broke up their relationship [-.　But//CO-]{+,　but//CO+} I hope that is n't true .
[-It　's//PH-]{+If　true　,　they　're//PH+} only an additional divorced couple .
The most important point is [-,//D-] that we should n't give so [-many//XC-]{+much//XC+} power or influence {+to//PR+} our press .
[-If　the　press　too　many　private　details　from　our　stars　publish//PH-]{+If　the　press　publishes　too　many　private　details　of　our　stars//PH+} , {+then//IS+} we should [-start　a//D-] boycott [-to//D-] this magazine .

In the last {+few//MW+} days I {+have//MW+} [-see//WC-]{+heard//WC+} a lot of [-gossips//SI-]{+gossip//SI+} of Gavin [-Taylor　's//SP-]{+Taylor//SP+} , in magazines , talk shows and newspapers .
{+space//IS+} But , [-sincerly//SP-]{+sincerely//SP+} , I think that it 's a strategy [-for//WC-]{+to//WC+} promote his new movie .
The last movie was awful and he received [-many//WC-]{+much//WC+} [-critics//WC-]{+criticism//WC+} and now [-He//C-]{+he//C+} needs {+to//PR+} be [-in//WC-]{+on//WC+} the [-first//WC-]{+front//WC+} page of each magazine and talk shows .
[-I　'm//SP-]{+I//SP+} agree with you , {+space//IS+} Gavin 's [-Girl//C-]{+girl//C+} , but the only [-conspirancy//SP-]{+conspiracy//SP+} that there is to show the movie .
He is a actor and [-billionare//SP-]{+billionaire//SP+} [-buisness　man//SP-]{+businessman//SP+} and forever will be at the point {+of//PR+} view .
He [-have//AG-]{+has//AG+} 18 songs and Home Improvement is one of the most popular [-song//PL-]{+songs//PL+} but it is n't in his unic LP called " Ashes " .
Home improvement [-show//AG-]{+shows//AG+} us his feelings of home town life , the lyrics of the song may seem sad but the rhythm of the instruments , especially the guitar , make a joyful and soft song .
Josh [-have//AG-]{+has//AG+} much talent and he can {+be//MW+} a new reference in a few years of a indie music .
Keep working Josh and we are waiting {+for//PR+} your new single !

I am {+a//AR+} dentist and I have a basic knowledge in English , but next year I will work in Canada , so I need to learn and practice the language .

To [-the　publisher　of　the　newspaper　''　The　Globe　''//WO-]{+The　Globe　Newspaper　Publisher//WO+} :
My friend [-has//D-] had a terrifying day [-,//D-] in which a very strange [-fact//WC-]{+event//WC+} happened [-that//WC-]{+and//WC+} I would like to [-publish//XC-]{+have　it　published//XC+} on your newspaper .
She was [-going　out//XC-]{+on　her　way//XC+} to work when she saw a young couple vandalizing the local [-newsagents//XC-]{+newsagent's　shop//XC+} [-,//PU-]{+;//PU+} she decided to go over [-to　then　to//XC-]{+and//XC+} see if she could get them to stop .
The woman waved a gun [-to//XC-]{+at//XC+} her , she pushed the gun into her stomach , and started talking fast about consumerism and the evils of the modern world .
After that {+,//PU+} the young woman grabbed [-the//XC-]{+her//XC+} laptop [-off　her//D-] and ran [-off//D-] down the street .
In the end {+,//PU+} the young woman was [-in　the　truth//XC-]{+actually//XC+} a teenage boy .

{+``//PU+} Black Swan {+``//PU+} is a suspense and psychological drama movie directed by Darren Aronofsky and has {+the　following//IS+} [-as//D-] principal actors : Natalie Portman , Mila Kunis , Vincent Cassel , Barbarian Hershey and Winona Ryder .
Nina Sayers ( Natalie Portman ) is a {+ballet//IS+} dancer of the New York Company [-of　ballet//D-] .
[-Her　life　is　entirely　consumed　by　the//EX-]{+She　dedicated　her　entire　life　in//EX+} dance .
Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel ) , decides to substitute the main dancer , Beth MacIntyre ( Winona Ryder ) , on the [-presentation　of　opening　of　the　season//WO-]{+Season　Opening　Presentation//WO+} , the Lake of the Swans , and Nina is his first choice .
[-But//WC-]{+However　,//WC+} a competitor appears : the new dancer , Lily ( Mila Kunis ) , that [-impressed//VT-]{+impresses//VT+} Thomas .
The Lake of the Swans requires a dancer capable in such a way to interpret the White Swan with innocence and favour , how [-much//D-] the Black Swan [-,　that//D-] represents malice and sensuality .
It is a [-beautiful//WC-]{+wonderful//WC+} movie .
Perhaps to abandon your work is n't the best choice in this moment [-,//NS-]{+.//NS+} I guess that you must face your [-fear//PL-]{+fears//PL+} .
There are [-too　the　physical　symptoms//WO-]{+the　physical　symptoms　too//WO+} : breathing problems , fainting , racing heart , shaking and sweating .
The best way is you [-look//WC-]{+consult//WC+} a doctor {+who　is　a//MW+} specialist in claustrophobia , he [-will//D-] can help you to [-understand//WC-]{+face//WC+} [-that//WC-]{+your//WC+} [-fear//PL-]{+fears//PL+} and treat the symptoms .

A new survey [-realized//D-] with a sample [-size　://XC-]{+size　of//XC+} 5000 people {+conducted//IS+} in the UK about the people 's attitudes to voices and British English accents shows a lot of interesting things .
81 % of the people change their voice depending on who they are talking to ( especially to ensure {+that//PS+} they are understood or to fit in better ) .
55 % of the people said {+that//PS+} the most disliked English accents are from the Midlands area of the UK .
Which are the probable [-reason//PL-]{+reasons//PL+} for these results ?
[-This//PS-]{+Is　this//PS+} survey is trustworthy ?
A common occurence in life is [-the//IS-]{+that//IS+} people change a career path five to seven times throughout [-in//D-] their life .
When [-the//D-] people are very young , they do n't know which way to follow or what they want of their lives and this finishes reflecting on the choice of [-the//IS-]{+their//IS+} work career .
When someone is discontent , the way is {+to//PR+} begin to contemplate altering the career path .
Another sufficiently important factor is the personality of each person , that is {+,//PU+} the preferences , the skill to carry through each activity and the pleasure on the [-work　that　is　carrying　through//IS-]{+job//IS+} .
When this moment of [-the//D-] choice arrives {+;//PU+} {+it//IS+} is important [-to//PR-]{+for//PR+} you to question yourself in few years about what you [-wait//IS-]{+want　from　life//IS+} [-of　your　life//D-] .
I talked with my lawyer about the overtime that I worked [-to//WC-]{+for//WC+} TransWorld Enterprises .

But before you run out to buy one of [-this//WC-]{+these//WC+} , think about the price .
I could n't believe [-in//D-] my eyes when I saw how much they was asking for it , I was surprised with the price , it is an absurdity !

I need to include in my report [-this//WC-]{+these//WC+} sections : title , terms of reference , procedure , findings , conclusions and recommendations .
About the findings , here are the points to be [-considerate//WC-]{+considered//WC+} :
Most people are happy with {+the//AR+} vacation days and sick days .
A constant [-complain//WC-]{+complaint//WC+} is about the overtime culture of the company .
[-Not　is　given　back　for//PH-]{+There　is　no　compensation　for//PH+} the work around the clock .
Most employees are satisfied with this area , but there is one negative point : a lot of time {+is　needed//MW+} to become eligible [-to//PR-]{+for//PR+} the advanced package ( they want less than two years ) .
The employees are very satisfied with this aspect , they have the necessary equipment and they know exactly their aims and [-objetives//SP-]{+objectives//SP+} .
The lines of [-report//WC-]{+reporting//WC+} are too long .
[-Thats//WC-]{+That//WC+} means a long time to get a decision on something .
I 'm writing because I want to [-ask　you//D-] [-apologies//WC-]{+apologize//WC+} for Selma 's visit .
It was my fault {+for//PR+} her behavior , because I did n't teach her {+about//MW+} our [-mores//WC-]{+culture//WC+} , and I ca n't believe that .
Although there is n't {+an//AR+} excuse , I 'd like to say that , in her country , talking about money is [-commom//SP-]{+common//SP+} ( there , this is not {+of//MW+} a taboo on the subject ) .
Moreover , she is a person that speaks her mind , but I 'm sure she did n't mean to offend you when {+she//MW+} insisted {+on//PR+} talking about money , costs , etc .
I know what I did was wrong and I [-promess//SP-]{+promise//SP+} you this will never happen again .
Once again , {+please//MW+} accept my apologies .
I m here to talk to you about the School [-Presidencial//SP-]{+Presidential//SP+} Campaign to which I m running for .
I promise you {+that//IS+} I am not going to take {+much　of//IS+} your time [-,//D-] because I m a student of few words and who likes to cut to the chase .
[-But　,//XC-]{+With//XC+} by action {+,//PU+} I d rather action here , within our school .
So , you can check my grades and you will see that I have been {+in//IS+} the first place in almost all subjects .
If I win [-,//PU-]{+;//PU+} I will represent your interests .
[-Futhermore//SP-]{+Furthermore//SP+} , we need [-cleaned//XC-]{+clean//XC+} bathrooms [-,//D-] because , [-nowadays　,　we　have　just　dirty　ones//XC-]{+what　we　have　,　lately　,　are　just　dirty　ones　.//XC+} .
[-After　this//WC-]{+Next//WC+} , I will fight for better conditions at the snack bar .
{+Word　limit//IS+} now , we have no options on food and drink , besides the high price of the products .
Yes , I know , you [-already　do//PH-]{+are　already　enjoying//PH+} it .
However , you can do it [-best//PS-]{+better//PS+} , {+by//PR+} living in my apartment .
Come {+and//IS+} [-to//D-] live in the best place [-of//PR-]{+in//PR+} San Francisco : the Pacific Heights .
The location provides a [-temperate//D-] micro - climate that is clearer , but not always warmer than many other areas of San Francisco .
Furthermore , you will have good restaurants and boutiques just few blocks {+away//IS+} [-of//PR-]{+from//PR+} you .
The [-recent//PS-]{+recently//PS+} remodeled modern kitchen , the rustic porch , the original [-wood//PS-]{+wooden//PS+} staircase and the trim {+atmosphere//IS+} throughout the house will knock your socks off .
[-And//WC-]{+Also//WC+} {+,//PU+} the rent is the best part of the advertisement : only $ 1 [-.//PU-]{+,//PU+} 850 per month .
I m writing [-in　way//D-] to discuss about the cards that we are selling .
During the weekend , I had an idea {+.//PU+} [-meanwhile//C-]{+Meanwhile//C+} {+,//PU+} I was watching a TV show about the recent increase [-of//PR-]{+in//PR+} the number of tree huggers in the last years .
Despite the fact that {+this//MW+} would be my first time , I ve got lots of experience from the African set and Animals of the Americas .
When you have time , I m ready to explain [-you//D-] the complete idea {+to　you//MW+} .
[-Im//VT-]{+I　have//VT+} always been a firm believer that our planet needs help .
Every day [-Earth//C-]{+earth//C+} continues [-being//VT-]{+to　be//VT+} destroyed .
We do n't care about the environment when using fossil fuels , dumping garbage [-through　the//PR-]{+to//PR+} nature and destroying forests [-to//PR-]{+for//PR+} the livestock .
As far as I m concerned , with [-US　$　80.000,00//XC-]{+US　$　80,000.00//XC+} we can finish the construction of these turbines and the transmission facilities .
I agree {+that//PS+} all those turbines are not so beautiful , but we can put them in places where there are n't so many visitors .
Even though the landscape [-become//AG-]{+becomes//AG+} uglier , our planet will thank us .
[-Therefore//HL-]{+Therefore//HL+} , do nt think they ca nt lock you up for a long time , because they can , even you are under 18 .
Being a recidivist will make you incarcerated again and again , [-thus//HL-]{+thus//HL+} , do nt play with fire .
I m {+the//AR+} brides father and I do nt need to thank anyone since I m giving the party , so lets cut to the chase .
I d like you standing [-to//PR-]{+for//PR+} the toast :

When I was young I never liked to [-treat　anyone　bullying//PH-]{+bully　anyone//PH+} .
At that time we [-could//WC-]{+could　n't//WC+} see this kind of discrimination because the world was not so competitive .
I guess that today fathers [-uses　to//D-] say to [-childrens//SP-]{+children//SP+} to get {+an//AR+} advantage and to be the best {+.//PU+} There is a friend of my [-sopn//SP-]{+son//SP+} that is fat and some people use to call him [-all　the　time　as　a　FAT　MAN//PH-]{+FAT　MAN　all　the　time//PH+} .
He [-doesnt//SP-]{+does　n't//SP+} like {+it//MW+} but nobody observes this and {+they//MW+} call him [-lots　of　time　as//D-] FAT MAN {+all　the　time//IS+} .
Nobody [-uses//WC-]{+used//WC+} to play or speak with that guy .
After [-suffer//WC-]{+suffering//WC+} discrimination for all {+his//MW+} life , some people {+do　n't//MW+} live apart of the society {+and//MW+} only [-staying//WC-]{+stay//WC+} at home and this kind of behaviour can , one day , explode and the person can have [-a//D-] terrible behaviour that can lead this person to enter in a school and kill lots of children , or enter in a cinema and try to kill people .
{+word　limit//IS+} In the past 30 years was not so common to have this kind of explosive behaviour , but as today we have [-internet//SP-]{+Internet//SP+} access that show lots of good things but also show terrorism , people killing , violence , and also we are living in a competitive world that everybody not like to respect others I believe that we will have more discriminated people killing to release themselves from their suffered lives .
Yesterday a friend of mine told me {+about//MW+} a terrible experience I would like to share with you .
He was walking [-at//WC-]{+on//WC+} the street with his laptop and other [-stufs//WC-]{+things//WC+} when some meters far from him a young couple [-get//VT-]{+got//VT+} out of the car .
They left [-an//AR-]{+the//AR+} engine running and the stetereo playing talking about the noise and air pollution .
After that my friend decided to go there and tried to stop the couple but the woman pushed a gun [-and　put　on　their//WC-]{+into　his//WC+} stomach telling him lots of words about consumerism and the evils of {+the//AR+} modern world .
For my friend surprised the girl {+and//MW+} instead of shoot him {+,//PU+} she grabbed his laptop [-off//D-] and ran off down the street .
Another person that was passing by that region caught the girl by the hair and she escaped [-.　But//CO-]{+,　but//CO+} not before this guy grabbed her hair , at which point it came off in his hands !
The cop has nt caught the couple yet and he [-loosed//WC-]{+lost//WC+} his laptop .
Wesley is an invaluable member of {+the//AR+} non - metalic raw material team .
He [-is//D-] always [-trying//VT-]{+tries//VT+} to solve [-the//D-] [-problem//PL-]{+problems//PL+} {+by//PR+} looking for the root cause .
Sometimes when he {+is//VT+} faced {+with//PR+} some problem he is bad humoured and nobody can speak to him .
When he is in trouble he always [-speak//AG-]{+speaks//AG+} more than he should and it affects his performance .
Another problem is that he always speaks more than he should and everybody [-try//AG-]{+tries//AG+} to stay [-far//WC-]{+away//WC+} from him to avoid [-loosing//WC-]{+losing//WC+} time {+in//PR+} speaking .
[-But//D-] [-when//C-]{+When//C+} he is travelling overseas he is a good colleague because he is funny and cooperative .
Another good point [-from//PR-]{+about//PR+} him is that when [-everybody//WC-]{+anybody//WC+} [-asked//VT-]{+asks//VT+} for [-their//SI-]{+his//SI+} help he is easygoing and [-help//AG-]{+helps//AG+} everybody .
He is a good guy [-that//WC-]{+who//WC+} besides his [-humour　alternancy//XC-]{+mood　swings//XC+} [-he//D-] is on the [-line//HL-]{+line//HL+} .
To show his performance it is important to point out that [-on//D-] last month he won a competition [-amongest//SP-]{+amongst//SP+} the best employees of the company .
He is {+'//PU+} the {+'//PU+} guy {+.//PU+}

In Flossington zoo you could prepare food and [-feeding//PS-]{+feed//PS+} [-your//WC-]{+the//WC+} wild animals .
I encourage you to work in this [-a//D-] zoo because you will have facilities to travel .
Let [-go　for//PH-]{+you　choose//PH+} the job !
Animals will be confident with you after one month , they would know you because you would give food and take care {+of//IS+} them .
I hope you would [-profite//SP-]{+profit//SP+} of this opportunity .
I {+will//IS+} wait {+for//IS+} your answer .
See you [-.//XC-]{+,//XC+} Yolande
What do you know about the meaning of {+the//MW+} word discrimination ?
When you see [-at//PR-]{+on//PR+} the TV a new discrimination , what do you think [-in//PR-]{+of//PR+} first ?
Who can be subject [-of//PR-]{+to//PR+} discrimination ?
What do you think about {+the//MW+} salary between a man and a woman in the same [-grade//WC-]{+job//WC+} ?
Dear Mr Martin , I am writing to apply for the job of {+a//AR+} [-fitness//C-]{+Fitness//C+} [-instructor//C-]{+Instructor//C+} in your centre .

Description of the trend [-on//PR-]{+in//PR+} the [-line//D-] graph .
On the line graph [-they//WC-]{+there//WC+} are two different curves .
International sales figures began [-in　2004　and　are　rising　sharply　one　year//PH-]{+to　rise　sharply　in　2004　,//PH+} [-and　steadily//D-] but in 2005 they fell dramatically by [-1M//XC-]{+!　million//XC+} .
And [-decreased　gradually//WO-]{+gradually　decreased//WO+} in 2007 and [-arrived　in　2008　to　0,5M//PH-]{+t　dramatically　fell　to　0.5　in　2008//PH+} .
National sales figures increased steadily by [-1M//XC-]{+1　million//XC+} [-.//D-] in 2005 and [-have//D-] had [-a//D-] [-stability//PS-]{+stabled//PS+} between 2005 [-to//WC-]{+and//WC+} 2006 .
They rose gradually by [-2,5M　.//XC-]{+2.5　million//XC+} in 2007 and decreased to [-2,5M　.//XC-]{+2.5　million//XC+} in 2008 .
If I compare these curves the peak is after 2007 for [-National//C-]{+national//C+} sales and between 2005 and 2006 for [-International//C-]{+international//C+} sales .
We mean that we have a financial stability between [-National//C-]{+national//C+} and [-International//C-]{+international//C+} sales despite the {+unsteady//IS+} movments [-which　increase　and　decrease//D-] .

Seeing is [-beliving//SP-]{+believing//SP+} !
Who has seen Gavin [-dated//VT-]{+dating//VT+} some woman personally ?
I would prefer to [-belive//SP-]{+believe//SP+} this is just commercial speculation for some [-mediates//HL-]{+mediates//HL+} .
Nowadays more and more people are interested in other people 's privacy [-,//PU-]{+,//PU+} especially [-celeberities//SP-]{+celebrities//SP+} , just because they do n't have too much work to do and get delighted from spreading rumors .
{+``//PU+} Home Improvement {+``//PU+} and Josh Woodward
This is one of Josh [-Woodward//PO-]{+Woodward　's//PO+} early period works .
With only vocals and guitars it makes a [-hamonious//SP-]{+harmonious//SP+} sound effect .
The pace of the song is mild and the tune is smooth [---//PU-]{+;//PU+} great [-molody//SP-]{+melody//SP+} !
The lyrics are about something negative , but a little [-humerous//SP-]{+humorous//SP+} and can make listeners feel nostalgic .
It is really an enjoyable song and {+a//AR+} great composition .
I am planning to go sightseeing in America this year , {+and//CO+} in [-Austrilia//SP-]{+Australia//SP+} next year .
I would like to ride a [-bycycle//SP-]{+bicycle//SP+} to some places in Europe and drive a SUV [-to　go//D-] around Africa .
I want to climb all {+the//AR+} famous [-maintains//SP-]{+mountains//SP+} in the [-worlds//SP-]{+world//SP+} .
I have climbed several well [-knowned//SP-]{+known//SP+} maintains in China , like Mountain Tai , Mountain Huang , Mountain Jiuhua .
I think most of my dreams can [-make//WC-]{+come//WC+} true , maybe the owning of a villa is just a dream for me -- too expensive !
However when the time was to get on board , the airport announced my flight was delaying , no [-surely//PS-]{+sure//PS+} time for the aircraft arriving .
[-A//AR-]{+An//AR+} hour passed , still no information about the departure and the airport staff did not explain the reason for [-dealy//SP-]{+delay//SP+} .
This made some passengers very [-angery//SP-]{+angry//SP+} , they were [-argruing//SP-]{+arguing//SP+} and claiming to have some compensation .
It was a really bad [-jurney//SP-]{+journey//SP+} .
{+Signature//IS+}
I am really flattered by your love , but I have {+been//IS+} involved with someone who works in our company .
I am sure you can find a girl who [-is　of//PH-]{+gives　you//PH+} the kind [-you//PR-]{+of//PR+} love {+you　need//IS+} .

At any [-way//WC-]{+cost//WC+} , please send [-me//D-] my glasses to the hotel in New York ASAP .
It would be distressing , if I could n't see the Skyline of N.Y [-.　not　clear//D-] .
Geezer Estate told me , {+he　is//IS+} not [-to　be//D-] responsible for this problem and told me {+not　to　contact//IS+} anymore [-,　to　contact//D-] {+but//IS+} the landlord .
Now {+,//PU+} I ask you for your advice about the correct [-responsibility//WC-]{+procedure//WC+} in this case .
I 'm waiting for your answer and I [-hope//WC-]{+need//WC+} [-for//D-] your help [-,//D-] if the problem [-will//D-] [-increase//WC-]{+continues//WC+} [-anymore//D-] .

[-The　most//D-] Meg 's terrifying day
[-In　the　path//XC-]{+On　the　way//XC+} , she had stopped [-in//PR-]{+at//PR+} the Coffee Pot and bought a non - fat mocha latte coffee .
Near [-to//D-] the corner at Elm and Fourth {+street//MW+} , she had seen a couple who got out of the car and had started vandalizing the local newsagents .
Suddenly the young woman had come to Meg waving a gun , she had [-put//WC-]{+pushed//WC+} it at Meg 's stomach and had started talking bad things about consumerism in a so fast way that {+it//MW+} was impossible to understand .
After that , the woman had grabbed [-the//D-] Meg 's notebook and had run off .
She almost was [-took//VT-]{+taken//VT+} by a passer - by who caught her by the hair,<<<<IS < correct>/correct > but the hair was a wig and somehow she had managed to scape .
[-It//WC-]{+You//WC+} [-is//WC-]{+can//WC+} {+be//MW+} observed that the international sales figures had a sharp increase during the first semester of [-the//D-] 2004 .
{+In//PR+} [-The//AR-]{+a//AR+} period of one year after , from the second semester of 2004 and the first semester of 2005 {+,//PU+} the growth was moderate .
After that {+,//PU+} there was a [-dramatically//WC-]{+dramatic//WC+} drop in sales from more than 2 m to 1 m and the sales [-had//D-] stagnated [-in//PR-]{+at//PR+} this level .
Between the [-final//WC-]{+end//WC+} of 2006 and the beginning of 2007 there was [-other//WC-]{+another//WC+} dramatic decrease [-by//PR-]{+of//PR+} 50 % and the level have [-kept//WC-]{+remained//WC+} {+there//MW+} until now .
Regarding the national sales figures {+,//PU+} we can observe a rapid increase in 2004 [-,//MW-]{+and//MW+} during 2005 there was a stagnation point [-in//PR-]{+at//PR+} 1 m [-of//D-] sales [-figures//D-] .
From the [-final//WC-]{+end//WC+} of 2005 up [-to//PR-]{+till//PR+} the first trimester of 2007 {+,//PU+} there was a sharp increase and in this period , {+the//AR+} first trimester of 2007 , there was a sales peak with 3 m [-in//D-] sales .

Edson is very sociable and very fun to go out {+with//PR+} .
He 's shown his better side helping [-coleagues//SP-]{+colleagues//SP+} in their studies since the beginning of our class .
Certainly he is the most helpful student and one of the most [-inteligent//SP-]{+intelligent//SP+} too .
Sometimes , [-specially//SP-]{+especially//SP+} when he is challenged or when {+he//IS+} someone does n't agree with him , he become pushy and [-agressive//SP-]{+aggressive//SP+} , it is [-perceptive//WC-]{+perceived//WC+} that he likes showing that he knows more than other people , and if it is true , he is friendly and helpful but if for some subject that is false , he shows his [-worse//WC-]{+worst//WC+} side .

I have known {+for　sometime//MW+} that you are thinking about [-leave//WC-]{+leaving//WC+} your job because of the fear of taking tubes and also because {+of//PR+} the new place of [-his//PO-]{+your//PO+} job which is , how can I say , not favorable for you .
You know that this is a phobia and I am happy to tell you that there are simple and effective [-s//D-] treatments .
It is simple and many who [-had//VT-]{+have//VT+} done {+this//MW+} were astonished [-on//PR-]{+with//PR+} their improvements .
The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) treats the patient {+'s//IS+} minds towards a more positive and rational way of thinking .
Also a therapy which contacts the patient with light claustrophobic situations and the therapist [-make//VT-]{+makes//VT+} the patient feel [-s//D-] safe .
Medicines can be used to manage [-sympthoms//SP-]{+symptoms//SP+} .
Ian , please , think about the [-tratment//SP-]{+treatment//SP+} and do not leave your job , it 's better for you .

{+For//PR+} [-Examples//C-]{+example//C+} , I could tell you [-for//PR-]{+about//PR+} {+it//IS+} all this night but I prefer to list the main ones : In 2008 I 've been in South Africa helping people who was suffering from lack of food , in 2009 I 've been in South America leadering a group of students who wants to help people homeless and suffering from many [-deseases//SP-]{+diseases//SP+} caused by various factors , in 2010 I helped the Charity Institution " Help Homeless Children " to collect funds in order to build a new place [-to//PR-]{+for//PR+} the children .
There [-is//AG-]{+are//AG+} plenty of things to do close the {+the//AR+} apartment like restaurants , bars , shopping centers , theater etc .
The kitchen was completely [-remolded//WC-]{+remodelled//WC+} .
But if you do n't like to cook , the kitchen will offer you enough space to organize better your things and activities inside {+the//AR+} kitchen [-in　order//WC-]{+so//WC+} you can do what you must do in the least time possible , spending little time there .
There is trim throughout {+the//AR+} house .
As all [-citzens//SP-]{+citizens//SP+} know , the hurricane Melinda [-had//VT-]{+has//VT+} [-devasted//SP-]{+devastated//SP+} {+the//AR+} south of our city [-,//PU-]{+.//PU+} [-with//C-]{+With//C+} winds of more than 110 mph {+,//PU+} [-she//WC-]{+it//WC+} destroyed [-everthing//SP-]{+everything//SP+} in [-her//WC-]{+its//WC+} path .
The damage is countable in numbers of [-deads//SP-]{+deaths//SP+} , 827 ; homeless families , more than 2500 and business destroyed , 82 .
[-But//WC-]{+However//WC+} , the thing that you probably do n't know yet is that you can help our city [-rebuilt//WC-]{+rebuild//WC+} and we need you !
[-Everthing//SP-]{+Everything//SP+} you need is [-willing//PS-]{+willingness//PS+} to help [-becasuse//SP-]{+because//SP+} there are {+a//AR+} lot of work to do and a big variety of work as well .
For [-exemple//SP-]{+example//SP+} , the city needs such people who like to work in contact with people and the rests of the disaster in order to [-make　the　debris　removal//XC-]{+remove　the　debris//XC+} , [-construing//WC-]{+construct//WC+} new homes , {+give//IS+} counseling , [-making//WC-]{+make//WC+} disaster kits {+,//PU+} etc [-,//PU-]{+.//PU+} [-But　,//D-] [-if//C-]{+If//C+} you are good at office jobs {+,//PU+} you can do [-administratives//SP-]{+administrative//SP+} works .
Do n't worry if you want to help but do n't have [-enouth//SP-]{+enough//SP+} time , you can also offer some financial assistance or donate blood .
Impressionists had studied the effect of natural light and used it in their [-paitings//SP-]{+paintings//SP+} .
The most famous [-paint//WC-]{+painting//WC+} of this movement is " The Road Bridge at Argenteuil " which was painted by Claude Monet in 1874 .
It was painted outside and we can see boats on the river [-Siene//SP-]{+Seine//SP+} in this picture .
The Expressionism , on the other hand , was created by two groups of German painters [-://PU-]{+.//PU+} {+The　paintings　that　will　be　explored　here　are//MW+} The Bridge and The Blue Riders , the last one was composed , by Frans Marc , Paul Klee [-,//D-] {+and//MW+} Wassily Kandinsky among others .
Franz Marc [-help　a　lot　this　movement//PH-]{+helped　this　movement　a　lot//PH+} .
Moreover , he did the most famous [-Expressionis//SP-]{+Expressionist//SP+} painting : " The Blue Rider " , and this painting excels for the bold colors , the form how Marc [-capture//WC-]{+captured//WC+} the primitive energy of animals , etc .
With geometrical forms and usually showing multiple viewpoints of one figure , it was {+a//AR+} forerunner of abstract art .
Not only changing your [-bahavior//SP-]{+behavior//SP+} in your job but also adapting your home can help you to withstand the pressure .
Getting money in a low paid job and climbing the ladder of the life step by step than [-commiting//SP-]{+committing//SP+} some crimes .
As you already know , since your brother [-commited//SP-]{+committed//SP+} the same mistake , this life will eventually lead you to prison .
This has no end and one day you will be in [-prision//SP-]{+prison//SP+} for your life thinking that you might as well be dead or why the life led you to that situation .
The life in [-prision//SP-]{+prison//SP+} is really not good .
Remember , freedom is the [-gratest//SP-]{+greatest//SP+} good the man has .
As far as I {+am//MW+} concerned , the TOEIC test and TOEFL English tests are good ways to prove your proficiency in English however they have {+a//AR+} [-differents//SP-]{+different//SP+} focus .
While {+the//AR+} TOEIC exam is most suitable for {+the//AR+} global workplace , TOEFL [-aim//AG-]{+aims//AG+} to academic issues .
Thus , even both are used as a measurement of your [-knowlodge//SP-]{+knowledge//SP+} in English , the first has its primary use to show for a company that you have the English skills while the second is used for Universities in academic programs .
Having this difference , the audience who do the tests are different , on the one hand TOEIC is mostly done by [-Employees//C-]{+employees//C+} in [-International//C-]{+international//C+} corporations , [-jobs//WC-]{+job//WC+} applicants and students in business or business English programs {+.//PU+} [-on//C-]{+On//C+} the other hand TOEFL is mainly done by students in colleges or Universities that have a language requirement and [-apllicants//SP-]{+applicants//SP+} to scholarships and exchange programs .
As her father I could say that I 'm a lucky person [-who　'd//WC-]{+who　had//WC+} the opportunity to , more [-that//WC-]{+than//WC+} [-taught//WC-]{+teaching//WC+} her about the life , be taught by her .
To be honest with you , when I met Doug , I did n't know they were dating but I thought [-with//WC-]{+to//WC+} myself that {+it//MW+} would be great if this could happens .
They 're together for three years and it 's impossible not {+to//MW+} remind me and Livia [-on//WC-]{+of//WC+} the [-begining//SP-]{+beginning//SP+} of our life .
I do n't need to thank everyone since I 'm giving the party , but I can say how happy I 'm to share the day with them {+.//PU+} My greatest wish for you both is that through the years your love for each other will grow so much , that years from now you will look back on this day , your wedding day , as the day you loved each other the least .
I ran to try [-stopping//XC-]{+and　stop//XC+} the dog [-bitting//SP-]{+biting//SP+} the child .
[-Everthing//SP-]{+Everything//SP+} happened really fast .
After that , [-I　and　some　people//XC-]{+some　people　and　I//XC+} who had arrived {+at//PR+} the place started to help the child .
There was a lot of blood [-in//PR-]{+on//PR+} the face and body of the child .
Arriving at the hospital , we discovered that the child [-healthy//D-] was " OK " .
You will never believe this , but if I had reached the dog some seconds after , the child would [-certaind　had//XC-]{+certainly　have//XC+} lost their vision and probably [-had//D-] died .
Here in Brazil we are relaxed , for this [-reazon//SP-]{+reason//SP+} , sometimes we get late to meetings .
However , we are a complex society formed by immigrants from many parts of the world thus , if you are talking with an [-japanease//SP-]{+Japanese//SP+} or [-german//SP-]{+German//SP+} descendant , keep a little bit more distant and respect a little more the space , on the other hand , if you are talking with a [-latin//SP-]{+Latin//SP+} descendant , and the most people here are [-latin//SP-]{+Latin//SP+} descendant , you can go close .

Dear friend , [-The//D-] Canad [-are//AG-]{+is//AG+} a wonderful country , but we will have to follow some tips :
We should n't yell down the street to a friend , [-to//D-] visit our friends too late , go out alone at night and must n't smoke in any public {+places//MW+} [-,//PU-]{+.//PU+} [-but//D-] [-we//C-]{+We//C+} can take a small gift when we [-to//D-] visit someone and when going through a door we should always let ladies {+go//MW+} first .
So , I had a date with that nice girl and I invited her in {+the//AR+} best restaurant of the city for a [-dinner　.Although//HL-]{+dinner　.　Although//HL+} , the name of {+the//AR+} restaurant , the meal was awful .
Beginning with the starters composed by seafood boiled but it was cold and [-prowns//SP-]{+prawns//SP+} on pink sauce they looked brown .
The first [-course　,　lamb//HL-]{+course　,　lamb//HL+} fried stuffed with potatoes [-fried　,　it//HL-]{+fried　,　it//HL+} looks well but it smelted bad as well as the plate of fresh vegetables they looked [-bad.Finally//HL-]{+bad　.　Finally//HL+} the dessert , sweet pie on a whipped white cream , it was too much sweet and cream {+and　it//MW+} tasted like an old shoe {+.//PU+}
I work in {+a//AR+} [-M//C-]{+m//C+} ultinational company and I frequently travel in many {+domestic//MW+} [-city//PL-]{+cities//PL+} [-of　my　country//D-] and [-abrod//SP-]{+abroad//SP+} [-too//D-] .
[-So　that//XC-]{+Thus　,　it//XC+} is hard for me to attend a regular course .
Eventually its very [-comfortable//WC-]{+convenient//WC+} and useful studying when I can .
I d like to focus on {+a//AR+} [-B//C-]{+b//C+} usiness language {+program//MW+} as well as {+in//PR+} [-daily//WC-]{+conversational//WC+} language in order to [-get//XC-]{+be//XC+} [-confidence//PS-]{+confident//PS+} in any life situation .
I hope to [-achive//SP-]{+achieve//SP+} a [-good//WC-]{+high//WC+} level and [-keep　it　always　in　form//XC-]{+maintain　my　standing//XC+} !

Dear [-friend//D-] Sally ,
I do n't know the country {+,//PU+} but I have read a lot about [-the//D-] Canadian culture [-,//PU-]{+.//PU+} [-it　's//C-]{+It　's//C+} very different [-from//PR-]{+to//PR+} ours .
You should greet {+Canadians　by//IS+} shaking their hands when you first meet .
When you visit someone {+,//PU+} you should always take a small gift [-,//PU-] {+because//IS+} this is nice , and you should n't stay late when visiting .
You must n't smoke in any public building [-,//PU-]{+;//PU+} it 's against the law .
{+WORD　LIMIT//IS+} Oh !
I heard {+that//MW+} you {+have//IS+} decided to resign because of your claustrophobic condition .

[-Besides　treatment　itself//PH-]{+Quite　apart　from　actual　treatments//PH+} , there [-is　a　lot　of//WC-]{+many//WC+} exercises and other [-stuffs//WC-]{+strategies//WC+} that can be helpful with [-that//PH-]{+the　treatment　of　this　condition//PH+} .
I know people who have had [-sucess//SP-]{+success//SP+} with simple breathing exercises , muscles relaxation and [-some　sort//PH-]{+different　kinds//PH+} of meditation {+techniques//MW+} , {+like//MW+} yoga and also , {+you　might　go　and　see//IS+} a therapist to help you out .
The most important thing [-,//IS-]{+is　that//IS+} you are not alone , you have people on your side who care about you .
We 'll give {+you//MW+} all the support you''ll need , so just calm down and rethink about [-that//WC-]{+this//WC+} decision .

Mark an area of [-abput//SP-]{+about//SP+} 8 meters x 3 metres [-.　It's　will　be//WC-]{+as　the//WC+} " Bowling alley " .
Use ten plastic bottles for " [-boling//SP-]{+bowling//SP+} pins " .

Let me [-introuduce//SP-]{+introduce//SP+} myself first .
I was born on Jan.12,1985 in a small village which belongs {+to//PR+} Henan Province , where I spent all of my childhood .
I used to play games in a small wood and a small river in front of our [-villiage//SP-]{+village//SP+} , especially in the summer , most of time we [-are//VT-]{+were//VT+} swimming and [-fishhing//SP-]{+fishing//SP+} in the river , it made us happy .
Our story occurred on one stormy night , when the trees were about to [-crashed//VT-]{+crash//VT+} down [-by//PR-]{+from//PR+} the terrible thunders , [-sometimes　showing　up　the　shadow　of　a　large　house//XC-]{+sometimes　showing　their　shadows　on　a　large　house//XC+} .
Suddenly , from the other side of the lake , appeared the [-headlight//PL-]{+headlights//PL+} of a car tearing up the darkness .
The car stopped in front of the house , and a man in {+a//AR+} black coat stepped out {+,//PU+} then knocked [-at//PR-]{+on//PR+} the door .
A few minutes passed with the echo of a heavy cane [-going//XC-]{+coming//XC+} downstairs , and a very old man with a tired look came out to open the door .
But I have been waiting so long for this day , to pay back what you gave to my father {+.//PU+} br/ > Then suddenly , he drew out a dagger and thrust it deep inside the breast of the old man .
+ Staff [-doesnt//XC-]{+do　n't//XC+} get enough [-feed　back//XC-]{+feedback//XC+} about their performance
So , they have to wait a long time for a decision {+.//PU+} * Conclusions : Good overall satisfaction .
There are thirteen computers , sixteen keyboards [-ande//SP-]{+and//SP+} sixteen headphones .
Best regards {+,//PU+} Carlos

Dear sir , I am writing to [-ask//WC-]{+seek//WC+} your advice about a problem I have with my landlord and real estate agent .
I 'm having problems [-to//PR-]{+in//PR+} getting my money back .
The lights did not work {+.//PU+} The drains and sinks were clogged and when I asked my money back , the homeowner simply said that I could not get {+it　back//MW+} because he would use {+the　money//MW+} to repair the damage that I caused .
I already threatened to go to the Law and [-claim//WC-]{+fight　for//WC+} the right of the consumer .
Please guide me {+as//IS+} to how I {+should//IS+} behave in such a situation .
[-grateful//C-]{+Grateful//C+}
[-ok//C-]{+OK//C+} , I think that you could be better [-in　other//WC-]{+another//WC+} time .
You could improve the [-aparence//SP-]{+appearance//SP+} [-,//PU-] because {+it//IS+} [-is　n't//VT-]{+was　n't//VT+} quite [-good　look//WC-]{+good-looking//WC+} at the plate .
The taste was good [-,//PU-] but smelled [-like//D-] burned {+,//PU+} and the portion [-is　n't//VT-]{+was　n't//VT+} equilibrated .
[-And//WC-]{+Also　,//WC+} the drink was [-terrible//PS-]{+terribly//PS+} hot and should [-be//VT-]{+have　been//VT+} cold .
So {+,//PU+} pay a [-litlle//SP-]{+little//SP+} more [-of//D-] attention and the customers will be back more [-happy//PS-]{+happily//PS+} !

Dear Sir [-or//PU-]{+///PU+} Madam ,
I am writing to enquire {+about//MW+} the possibility of requesting the loan to open a mortgage .
I would like to buy the house because I think it will be cheaper in the long run than [-to　rent　it　.//XC-]{+paying　rent　for　it//XC+} {+.//PU+} It 'll also give me [-the//AR-]{+a//AR+} sense of stability , independence from the landlord and the freedom to make changes in the decor and the landscape .
I am [-currantly//SP-]{+currently//SP+} paying $ 800 per month and I have an adequate salary of $ 2000 per month to afford the mortgage payments .
I look forward to [-hearing//VT-]{+hear//VT+} from you soon .
Not only do I have the same position in my work history , special educational background and certificates , but I {+also//IS+} have a great passion for fitness and health , the strong motivation and desire to encourage others to become fit and healthy .
I [-am//D-] also believe that my good level of fitness , enthusiasm and exellent communication skills will increase your clientele .
This property with sunsets , which are some of the ' most stunning you can see [-anythere//SP-]{+anywhere//SP+} in the world ' oozes with magic .
It is situated in a very good place between Kefalonia and Ithaca [-.　But//CO-]{+but//CO+} it does n't fit many client 's requirements .
Also {+,//PU+} the cottage does need a new roof .
Meets most ot client 's needs : it is big enough , has many rooms , so it is possible to have their own rooms for each family [-memeber//SP-]{+member//SP+} .
Also {+,//PU+} it retains a hotelier licence , it is good to rent it out if decided .
The price of 1.5 [-mln//SP-]{+ml//SP+} Euro is not the obstacle , because money is no object in the case the property meets needs and oozes with magic .
This affordable apartments is good for buyers looking to invest in tourism on a Greek Island , but does n't meet our client 's need to have a perfect family holiday home ( only 2 bedrooms in each [-appartment//SP-]{+apartment//SP+} ) .

I 've found you [-a//AR-]{+an//AR+} excellent [-want　ad//WC-]{+advertisement//WC+} .
Have you ever [-think　that//PH-]{+thought　of//PH+} working in a Zoo ?
It is not [-a　simply//WO-]{+simply　a//WO+} yard with some Pigs and Rabbits .
This job {+is//IS+} enough to satisfy all your desires .
I mean to work outside with amazing animals , and be in charge of [-feesing//SP-]{+feeding//SP+} them {+!//PU+} What a [-dreamlike//WC-]{+dream//WC+} [-for//WC-]{+to//WC+} [-lions　feeding//WO-]{+feed　lions//WO+} with the notice " Do not feed the lions " .

- 18 month of work shall [-qualifie//SP-]{+qualify//SP+} for the Advanced Package
- allow managers of lower levels more autonomy or remove some layers of [-managment//SP-]{+management//SP+}
It 's better [-to//D-] value for sure .
I promise that I 'll nevern {+again//IS+} forget to introduce people with another background to our culture and way of live {+first//IS+} before inviting them in the future .
It 's because of my strong conviction , my motivation and my sense [-for//PR-]{+of//PR+} justice !
I 'll not only promise you to raise [-a　fund//PL-]{+funds//PL+} for new chairs and tables , but also to improve the quality of the teachers through a new evaluation system !
Furthermore I 'll convince the Principal to expand the [-maximal//SP-]{+maximum//SP+} quantity of school excursions and to employ qualified staff for a better coordination of [-the//D-] schedules .
I believe , that together we can make our school a better place [-.　But//D-] therefore , I need your support .

We need volunteers in these sectors : - construction work ( [-You//C-]{+you//C+} will help us to construct temporary shelters )

[-Clautrophobia//SP-]{+Claustrophobia//SP+} is an irrational phobia , but people who suffer from it ca n't control it .

It is a common [-occurrance//SP-]{+occurrence//SP+} that working people find out they are on the wrong career path .
It is necessary to analyze [-themself//SP-]{+themselves//SP+} , to find out about their own personality ( like introvert or extrovert ) , [-intrests//SP-]{+interests//SP+} and working style ( rather work alone or with others ) by watching [-themself//SP-]{+themselves//SP+} and their behavior closely in private life .
Once they know what their preferences are , they can take a free online test about which career suits {+them//MW+} the best .
The potatoes were delicious , I really liked the way they were marinated with all [-these//AR-]{+the//AR+} spices and the garlic .

The second boy likes to be adventurous and makes his own [-thing//PL-]{+things//PL+} and the third one is really a smart boy .
[-Specially//SP-]{+Especially//SP+} when I think about what happened this year in Japan !
One I will try to tell you : We slept for some nights in a camp in the middle of a National [-Parc//SP-]{+Park//SP+} in Tanzania .
One afternoon we [-turned　from　our//WC-]{+visited　the//WC+} safari , where we met many animals {+,//PU+} the ' big five ' .
We were hungry , tired [-and//PU-]{+,//PU+} [-transpired//WC-]{+dirty//WC+} and all dusty - we were longing for a shower , a change of our dresses and a good dinner in the restaurant .
Dear {+Mr　.//IS+} James , Some serious problems have been brought to my attention relating to your working style and habits .
The [-most//D-] important [-thing//PL-]{+things//PL+} you have to change are [-the　habits　in　your//XC-]{+your　attitude　toward//XC+} teamwork and [-the//PO-]{+your//PO+} [-style//WC-]{+manner//WC+} of communication with [-the//PO-]{+your//PO+} colleagues .
[-Think　about//XC-]{+You　need　to　improve//XC+} your time management [-!//PU-]{+.//PU+} You must be punctual and it [-does　n't//XC-]{+does　not//XC+} [-go//WC-]{+follow//WC+} [-,//D-] that you [-never//XC-]{+will　not　have　to//XC+} update the database .
To work in a friendly , [-correctly//WC-]{+proper//WC+} and tidy [-way　makes//XC-]{+workplace　is//XC+} part of [-professionality//WC-]{+professionalism//WC+} .
{+-Word　limit-//IS+} Think about !
Later on when I [-will　be//AG-]{+am//AG+} more [-fluid//XC-]{+fluent//XC+} in speaking English , I [-even//D-] want to improve my French and I hope to find [-also　for　the　French　language　a　good　online　study　program//WO-]{+a　good　online　study　program　for　the　French　language//WO+} like this one of Englishtown.de .

Tsunami can cause flooding , {+so//IS+} do not go into the basement .
I want to apologize for [-all//D-] what happened [-in//PR-]{+at//PR+} this restaurant .
Other times , when I [-stood//WC-]{+ate//WC+} there I was always satisfied , but the waiter last week was a real misfortune .
The service was so bad , that I complained [-that//D-] in a letter to the manager .
I was born on March 25th 1947 in Berlin , where I lived [-up　to//WC-]{+until//WC+} thirty .
My first serious job I began in 1974 in an [-elemetary//SP-]{+elementary//SP+} school always in Berlin .
I found a good job in an European School in the [-nothern//SP-]{+northern//SP+} part of Italy .
It was very interesting and also good [-payed//WC-]{+salary//WC+} .
Let me tell you why you should apply [-.//PU-]{+://PU+} It is the Flossington Zoo who is looking for a zookeeper .
The salary with $ 50.000 is absolutely satisfying , specially when you consider that they offer [-regulary//SP-]{+regularly//SP+} trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles .
And if will happen an accident {+,//PU+} Flossington Zoo offers full accident assurance .
{+space//IS+} It is a position I have long aspired to achieve .
Not only do I [-remarkable　have　an//PH-]{+have　a　remarkable　and//PH+} excellent education and work history , but I have the motivation and desire to encourage other people to become fit and healthy .
I hope to hear soon from you {+.//PU+} Sincerely yours {+,//PU+} A.B.
The first look [-on//PR-]{+at//PR+} the graph shows that both , national sales and international sales had a [-steadily//XC-]{+steady//XC+} increase before decreasing .
Let 's have a [-//XC-]{+closer//XC+} look [-on//PR-]{+at//PR+} the graph .
Then international sales fell abruptly [-to　arrive//D-] in 2007 to only 1 million , then fell again in the first months of 2007 and then remained [-steadily//XC-]{+steady//XC+} up [-to//PR-]{+until//PR+} 2008 .
The national sales [-instead　after　the　top　in　2005//D-] remained {+at　1　million//MW+} up to 2006 [-with　1　million//D-] and then rose again steadily and reached {+the　highest　figure//MW+} in the first months of 2007 [-the　highest　top　with//PR-]{+at//PR+} more than 2 million sales , then fell again [-up//D-] to about 1,5 million sales in 2008 .
The weight of 10 ozs is fascinating , offering the same that [-do　the　others//WO-]{+the　others　do//WO+} - {+and//MW+} even more .
And all [-incluse//SP-]{+inclusive//SP+} for only ' 235 .
It seems no longer necessary to [-beat//WC-]{+struggle//WC+} with foreign languages !

[-hey//XC-]{+Hi//XC+} ,
The first day of the holiday , we decided ( my wife and I ) to register the [-chidren//SP-]{+children//SP+} in the skiing school first and we took the chair lift for going to {+start//MW+} skiing .
[-we//C-]{+We//C+} skied [-during//D-] all the morning and before the lunch time , we decided to go back [-at//PR-]{+to//PR+} the school to take the children .
They [-was　always//XC-]{+were//XC+} in the baby track [-to　learned//D-] .
I [-have　thinking//VT-]{+thought//VT+} that it was a good idea if [-i//C-]{+I//C+} went with [-they//WC-]{+them//WC+} [-to　go　down//PR-]{+on//PR+} this baby track .
When we arrived at the end of the track suddenly my left shoe was open and I [-do//VT-]{+did//VT+} not know what [-happend//SP-]{+happened//SP+} but [-i//C-]{+I//C+} was down with a terrible pain in my leg .
I [-have//VT-]{+had//VT+} broken my leg in the baby track {+on//PR+} the first day of the winter holidays {+and//MW+} it was [-creasy//SP-]{+crazy//SP+} .
[-Frst//SP-]{+First//SP+} of all I want to [-introdruce//SP-]{+introduce//SP+} me : My name is Bettina and I''m a candidate for student council president .
Consider that [-I　''　am　for　two　years　ia　council　member　now//XC-]{+I　have　been　a　council　member　for　two　years　now//XC+} and I know how things [-working　there//XC-]{+operate//XC+} .
[-Futhermore//SP-]{+Furthermore//SP+} [-I　''　am//XC-]{+i　have　been　a//XC+} student for 4 years [-on//PR-]{+at//PR+} this school and nobody knows your needs better than I.
If you {+for//PR+} vote me I''ll convince the teachers to have no lessons every [-monday//SP-]{+Monday//SP+} morning because I know that everybody is tired from {+the//AR+} weekend !
I {+know　I　can//MW+} count on you !
I will also persuade the teachers to show a film [-in//PR-]{+for//PR+} at least one lesson every week .
The council president is a very [-resbonsible//SP-]{+responsible//SP+} job [-an//SP-]{+and//SP+} I''m your woman [-for　that//D-] !
I can''t encourage you enough to go to the election on [-friday//SP-]{+Friday//SP+} and vote for me !
[-it//C-]{+It//C+} was the best [-hamburguer//SP-]{+hamburger//SP+} that I {+have//IS+} ever eaten .
All the ingredients [-are//VT-]{+were//VT+} {+of//IS+} high quality , the cheese [-in//D-] [-special//XC-]{+specially//XC+} was great .
The french fries [-aren//VT-]{+were　n't//VT+} ' ' t greasy and the milkshake of Ovomaltine [-ever//D-] [-is//VT-]{+was//VT+} good !
[-the//C-]{+The//C+} [-catchup//WC-]{+ketchup//WC+} and the [-mustard　Heinz//WO-]{+Heinz　mustard//WO+} gave a special flavor .
The appearance of {+the//IS+} food was as good as the taste .
The meal was rare too but I didn''t complain because I [-like//PH-]{+liked　it//PH+} , but my wife [-don　''　t//VT-]{+did　n't//VT+} like {+it//IS+} much and complained , but in general , she liked so much too .
I am glad with your response regarding my [-aplication//SP-]{+application//SP+} in your online study program .
More and more people have little time for [-your//WC-]{+their//WC+} family and [-,//D-] spend most part of [-your//WC-]{+their//WC+} time thinking [-in//PR-]{+of//PR+} [-your//WC-]{+their//WC+} carrier .
[-Study//PS-]{+Studying//PS+} online reduces the travel time , people could use this time on more important things .
Furthermore , I can make my study [-hour//PL-]{+hours//PL+} and decide how long will be .
My goal is to learn [-english//C-]{+English//C+} , It is my best dream currently .
In this topic , we could [-to//D-] use many [-differents//SP-]{+different//SP+} subjects like new [-tecnologies//SP-]{+technologies//SP+} , computers , sports , etc .
These are the subjects that I would like to study , English , computation , {+and//IS+} mathematics .
With the online study , I hope to achieve the same things that I could achieve [-on//PR-]{+in//PR+} the class room , but in a less time because I {+will//MW+} study when I have desire , not when I have to study .
[-thank//C-]{+Thank//C+} you .

[-I　'll//WC-]{+I　'm//WC+} [-gonig//SP-]{+going//SP+} to {+go//MW+} camping .
I''m taking a tent , a sleeping bag , towels , toilet paper [-,//D-] {+and//MW+} a [-backpag//SP-]{+backpack//SP+} .
It 'll be hot and sunny , so [-i　'll//C-]{+I　'll//C+} need [-sunclasses//SP-]{+sunglasses//SP+} and sunscreen .
{+Yours　sincerely　,//MW+} {+Your　Name//MW+}

Dear Mr. Harry Martin , [-thank//C-]{+Thank//C+} you for your email asking me about a short outline of my [-qualification//PL-]{+qualifications//PL+} and motivation [-about//PR-]{+for//PR+} the job [-as//PR-]{+of//PR+} a fitness trainer .
I think I am very qualified for this job because I {+have//VT+} already worked as a P.E.
There I had to motivate kids to do sport and have fun [-with//WC-]{+doing//WC+} it .
As you know {+,//PU+} the aspect of motivation is very important in the job of a fitness trainer .
And there is is no better training to get {+to　be//MW+} a perfect motivator than working together with kids .
But I am not only a good motivator , I am also [-theroretically//SP-]{+theoretically//SP+} very [-good//WC-]{+well//WC+} qualified .
I passed many exams and [-I　took　part　in　many　qualifications//PH-]{+acquired　many　certificates　and　diplomas//PH+} [-.　Therefore　I　reached　a　lot　of　qualifications//D-] like the ACE or AED .
Furthermore {+,//PU+} I am qualified as [-a//AR-]{+an//AR+} instructor in different [-kind//PL-]{+kinds//PL+} of sports like Kickboxing , Yoga [-or//WC-]{+and//WC+} Pilates .
{+word　limit//IS+} Moreover I have a Bachelor degree in Physical Health and Fitness Education .
The dotted line shows the international sales figures and the other one {+shows//MW+} the national sales figures .
After their [-peak//AG-]{+peaks　,//AG+} both graphs show a gradual decline [-.//PU-] [-Whereby//C-]{+whereby//C+} the national sales figures level out to [-aproximately//SP-]{+approximately//SP+} 1.5 m and the international sales figures to 0.5 m .
Well , Ulli is a real [-people//XC-]{+people　's//XC+} person .
He is very communicative and gets in touch [-to//PR-]{+with//PR+} nearly everyone .
But I must say he [-is　talking　more　than　he　is　working//PH-]{+talks　more　than　he　works//PH+} .
Maybe he can make good presentations [-.//PU-]{+,//PU+} [-Especially//C-]{+especially//C+} if the topic is not that complicated and someone else {+has//MW+} prepared the slides for him .
Even so he has his problems when he [-should//WC-]{+needs　to//WC+} solve more complex problems .
Then his strategy seems to be [-the//D-] [-comunitcation//SP-]{+communication//SP+} .
He tries to [-sked//XC-]{+ask//XC+} anyone to help him {+,//PU+} or better do his his job in order to [-say//WC-]{+tell//WC+} the boss that he is unable to solve the given task .

They [-even//WC-]{+too//WC+} [-believed//VT-]{+believe//VT+} that it is not my fault .

Author : Zuenir [-ventura//C-]{+Ventura//C+} Type of story : Based on {+a//AR+} true story
Zuenir Ventura , [-a//AR-]{+an//AR+} award - winning [-jornalist//SP-]{+journalist//SP+} , wrote an excellent book about a terrible human [-felling//SP-]{+feeling//SP+} called envy .
The author mixed true stories and fiction [-to//D-] to explain and exemplify the envy .
The main story is about {+a//AR+} love triangle [-composed　of//PR-]{+among//PR+} [-trhee//SP-]{+three//SP+} friends ( Katia , Gustavo and Rodrigo ) .
Rodrigo is {+a//AR+} lier and [-wish//AG-]{+wishes//AG+} his friend lost everything .
After 3 years ' living and studying here , I feel that [-the//D-] most of our tutors and professors of my school are rather impeccable .
Compared with other universities ' , they are more [-proffesional//SP-]{+professional//SP+} and responsible .
In the classes , they appear to be so enthusiastic that we {+are//VT+} all attracted by their speech .
They always let us think a lot and search {+for//PR+} more information after classes .
[-Everytime//SP-]{+Every　time//SP+} there is a high quality course [-of//PR-]{+or//PR+} lecture , they often try their best to obtain tickets for us so that we have more chances get touch with the latest news [-of//PR-]{+in//PR+} our own field .
There exist a handful of teachers who [-dissapointed//VT-]{+disapoint//VT+} us .
They do not think highly of their students , hastily [-endding//SP-]{+ending//SP+} their everyday class and disappearing immediately after class .
[-Sometimes//D-] [-this//C-]{+This//C+} [-phenomenan　would　happen//WC-]{+happens　sometimes　,　but//WC+} generally speaking , however , the quality of [-staffs//PL-]{+staff//PL+} is [-in　the　best　ranks//WC-]{+of　the　highest　standard//WC+} .
I wonder {+if//PR+} it could [-do//WC-]{+get//WC+} better in the future .
Dear Lan , I heard that you would quit your job and the reason is {+because//MW+} your deeply scared of the enclosed places right ?
[-Why　do　you　so　chicken-hearted　this　time//HL-]{+Why　do　you　so　chicken-hearted　this　time//HL+} ?
Actually , what you have is [-the//D-] claustrophobia , which is an irrational fear of enclosed spaces .
You may feel very [-anxiety//WC-]{+anxious//WC+} , panic , and afraid of the [-dangerous//WC-]{+dangers//WC+} which actually do n't exist .
It is really [-a//D-] [-proud//WC-]{+awsome//WC+} [-of//PR-]{+for//PR+} me to stand here and urge you to vote me .
I can assure {+you//MW+} that if you vote for me , I would try my best to make changes .

Serena , the victim 's wife , said her husband shouted and drove [-het//SP-]{+her//SP+} mad .
This was not the first time , he sometimes shouted [-,//D-] {+and//MW+} hit her {+,//PU+} especially after drinking .
She did n't want to kill {+her　husband//IS+} [-.//PU-]{+,//PU+} but she picked up a knife and stabbed him .

She usually works until late at night [-,//D-] and her daughter interrupts her a lot .

After visiting me , she got some [-colclusions//SP-]{+conclusions//SP+} .
First thing is that there is some hidden intention behind her [-daugher　's//SP-]{+daughter　's//SP+} [-interrption//SP-]{+interruptions//SP+} .
It was that she was bored and did not know what to do [-.　So//CO-]{+,　so//CO+} she can have some time with her daughter during the day time .
She also told her daughter [-that//D-] how much and why her interruptions are [-inappropeiate//SP-]{+inappropriate//SP+} .
They have been doing that for a month [-,//D-] and {+have　been//VT+} very effective so far .
It [-is//D-] really worked out well .

Agency , I had to do a list about all the [-problem//PL-]{+problems//PL+} [-causingby//PR-]{+in//PR+} the house .
Then , here you [-are//WC-]{+have//WC+} my list : sink [-leakead//WC-]{+leaked//WC+} , door [-broken//WC-]{+broke//WC+} [-,//CO-]{+and//CO+} windows [-which//D-] closed badly .
Next , I 've [-picked//WC-]{+placed//WC+} up on the internet [-many//WC-]{+a　lot　of//WC+} [-informations//WC-]{+information//WC+} describing the rules in {+the//AR+} matter [-some//PR-]{+of//PR+} consumer protection ,
Thank you [-by//PR-]{+in//PR+} advance dear lawyer for your answer .

Keep this feedback [-about//XC-]{+as　this　is//XC+} my additional advice .
You must [-take　in　your　mind　whole　the　meal　to　have　served//XC-]{+remember　this　feedback　as　it　will　help　you　serve　a　good　meal//XC+} .
It was unbelievable [-to　bring　a　dish　unheatly//XC-]{+when　you　brought　an　unhealthy　dish//XC+} for an overweight man .
The sausages and potatoes [-,　garnished　over　hat　fried//XC-]{+were　deeply　fried//XC+} .
Normally , you {+will//MW+} have to make a menu {+and//MW+} incorporate fresh vegetables {+into　the　dishes//MW+} , [-therefore　with　good　heatly//XC-]{+such　dishes　will　be　healthy//XC+} !
[-That's　a　same　thing　to　thinking　at//XC-]{+I　feel　the　same　thing　about//XC+} the desert .
Why do n't you [-cooking//WC-]{+make//WC+} a desert with [-a//D-] fewer calories ?
[-Personnaly//SP-]{+Personally//SP+} , I {+would//MW+} prefer to [-eat//WC-]{+have//WC+} a salad of fresh fruit , [-that's　a　better　choose　indeed//XC-]{+instead　of//XC+} your over sweet ice cream .
Let me tell you why you should apply to set your [-canditature//SP-]{+candidature//SP+} .
I 'm so [-exciting//WC-]{+excited//WC+} to [-afford//WC-]{+tell//WC+} you some benefits
It would [-to//D-] be by far the most impressive experience [-which//D-] you have known .
Think about that : learning to give some food for the animals in safety , then understand their [-strenght//SP-]{+strenghth//SP+} and their weakness for better to taking a care them and finally watching the behaviour from wild animals really dangerous .
So many incredible stories you will can to tell [-at　yours　children　to　the　next//HL-]{+at　yours　children　to　the　next//HL+} !
Besides , these [-knowledges//SP-]{+knowledge//SP+} are absolutely the most exhilarating interest from whatever work around the world !
I have totally some trust about skills toward [-you　sincealways//HL-]{+you　sincealways//HL+} .
[-Morever//SP-]{+Moreover//SP+} , I 'm saying to you all my encouragement to the near future .
Dear [-Sir//C-]{+sir//C+} and madam ,
I [-have　the　honour//VT-]{+would　like//VT+} to enquire [-you//D-] about {+the　possibility　of　requesting//MW+} a loan .
Indeed , I would like to buy the house [-there　to　living　where　I　must　pay　my　rent//XC-]{+that　I　am　currently　living　in//XC+} .
According to the benefits about interest tax from {+the//AR+} government and mortgage savings , [-later//XC-]{+I　would　benefit　from　getting　the　loan//XC+} .
I [-urge　you　about　this　request　to　the　fact　which　I　neverhave　been//XC-]{+have　never　had//XC+} an overdraft and I always [-payed//SP-]{+paid//SP+} my bills in the

Whatever you 're doing in your life , you have always dreamt to communicate with [-the//WC-]{+all//WC+} [-kind//WC-]{+kinds//WC+} [-world　's//PR-]{+of//PR+} people .
Well , today with [-ours//WC-]{+our//WC+} tiny media center handy translators , [-we　'll//WC-]{+we//WC+} can access [-to//D-] the great languages [-over//WC-]{+across//WC+} the oceans .
I know , you 're craving to try [-ours//WC-]{+our//WC+} [-news//WC-]{+new//WC+} modern models [-fitting//WC-]{+fitted//WC+} to everyone .
These three models including at least 50 languages and 500 useful phrases except [-to//D-] the teenager model .

2- Do n't put [-to//PR-]{+on//PR+} the [-net//C-]{+Net//C+} [-some//WC-]{+any//WC+} pictures from you ( especially wearing a bathing - suit ) .
The pictures remain [-while//PR-]{+for//PR+} several years on the [-internet//C-]{+Internet//C+} .
3- Do n't chat about your boss [-not//D-] anymore {+,//PU+} because someday somebody {+will//MW+} [-say//WC-]{+tell//WC+} [-to//D-] him {+about　what　you　said　about　him//MW+} .
4-Avoid [-to//D-] [-converse//WC-]{+conversing//WC+} about your last bargain lost , obviously someone else {+will　try//MW+} to benefit {+from　it//MW+} for himself .

Of course {+,//PU+} someday a colleague will learn {+about//PR+} it [-,//MW-]{+and//MW+} so he {+will//MW+} tell [-to//D-] your boss {+about　it//MW+} .

The investigation 's report outlining [-of//D-] mister Nelson 's murder .
On August 31th 2012 , at 11 pm in the evening , a crime had [-occured//SP-]{+occurred//SP+} [-of//PR-]{+at//PR+} the Nelson 's residence on Sherbrook ### street .
From the first [-witnesses//SI-]{+witness//SI+} , a violent [-argue//WC-]{+argument//WC+} between Sabrina Nelson and her husband Dave Nelson had warned the neighbourhood .
Seemingly , mister Thymottee Maclour {+,//PU+} the main witness {+,//PU+} was working on his computer during the events .
He was downloading some files when suddenly he heard increasingly [-of//D-] [-maniacals//SP-]{+maniacal//SP+} scream from the kitchen of his neighbours {+which//IS+} overlooked his home .
By the time , he leaned out his window and clearly saw the [-eventfull//SP-]{+eventful//SP+} facts .
The witness claimed that Dave Nelson {+was//IS+} furious {+and//IS+} lost [-his//D-] control , so {+he//IS+} hit Sabrina Nelson [-to//PR-]{+on//PR+} her face .
Hence , she was [-upsetting//WC-]{+upset//WC+} and injured [-to//PR-]{+on//PR+} her left arm because of the shock .
Then , when she was raising herself up , she had clutched a knife [-layed//SP-]{+laid//SP+} on the table .
Ultimately , he {+was//IS+} [-deadly//WC-]{+seriously//WC+} wounded and lost too much blood before the assistance reached him .
[-Message　from　France　to　Mr　Blumqwist　,　Assistant　of　communication　about　delegation　of　International　exchange　.//D-] Dear Mr Blumqwist ,

Next , I {+will//IS+} stick to my belief that you should bring a simple present from your interesting country .
Then , you may start by saying that you are happy to come [-in//PR-]{+to//PR+} France and [-make　a　little　compliment//XC-]{+tell　something　positive//XC+} about {+the//AR+} French [-touch　on//XC-]{+related　to//XC+} business attitude .
After {+that//IS+} , it 's my own contention that you have to greet the [-senior//PL-]{+seniors//PL+} of the company at first with a straightforward handshake .
It is [-an　advisable　choice　to　carry//XC-]{+advised　to　wear//XC+} a necktie [-matched　with　a　fashionable//XC-]{+matching　your//XC+} jacket to steer a great deal .
As you can guess , try to avoid talking {+about//PR+} [-politic//SP-]{+politics//SP+} during a meal .
